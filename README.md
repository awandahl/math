# Math databases

A simple resource page for a workshop about getting started with the two major bibliographic databases in mathematics.

#### How to access:

**zbMATH:** https://zbmath.org/    
**MathSciNet:** https://mathscinet.ams.org   |   From outside of campus go [here](https://focus.lib.kth.se/login?URL=https://www.ams.org/mathscinet/) 
**MathSciNet:** https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/beta/publications-search   |   From outside of campus go [here](https://focus.lib.kth.se/login?URL=[https://www.ams.org/mathscinet/](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/beta/publications-search))

#### Handouts   

ETH Zürich has very good handouts covering these databases:    

[Introduction to the database zbMATH Open – Zentralblatt MATH](https://github.com/awandahl/math/blob/main/ETH_2022-03-11-ZentralblattMATH_Handout_EN.pdf)    
[Introduction to the database MathSciNet – Mathematical Reviews](https://github.com/awandahl/math/blob/main/ETH_2022-03-11-MathSciNet_Handout_EN.pdf)

MathSciNet has a new interface coming up soon:

### About

**zbMATH:** "Currently, zbMATH Open contains around **4.4 million** bibliographic entries with reviews or abstracts drawn from more than 3,000 journals and book series, and some 190,000 books. Our coverage, which starts in the 18th century, is complete from 1868 to the present day..."    

**MathSciNet:** "MathSciNet® contains over **3.6 million** items and over 2.3 million direct links to original articles. Bibliographic data from retrodigitized articles dates back to the early 1800s. Reference lists are collected and matched internally from approximately 650 journals, and citation data for journals, authors, articles and reviews is provided..."

### 1. Simple search  

#### Searching **without** quotation marks:    


*climate change*    

#### Results    
**zbMATH:** 1168    
**MathSciNet:** 968    

#### Searching **with** quotation marks:    

*"climate change"* 

#### Results
**zbMATH:** 996    
**MathSciNet:** 715

### 2. Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)
MSC results for "climate" from *searching the classification scheme* in [zbMATH](https://zbmath.org/classification/) or [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freeTools.html?version=2)    

````
86 (1940-now) Geophysics [See also 76U05, 76V05]    
	86A (1980-now) Geophysics [See also 76U05, 76V05]    
		**86A08** (2020-now) Climate science and climate modeling    
````
#### Results
**zbMATH:** 223    
**MathSciNet:** 130/242 (primary/secondary)

### 3. Advanced search    

a) *I want to find documents about the climate change and how it affects the oceans*        

My example:    

**zbMATH:**  any:ocean* & cc:86A08  = 58    
**MathSciNet:** MSC Primary/Secondary=(86A08) AND Anywhere=(ocean*) = 35    

b) *I want to find documents about applications of [tropical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry)*

**zbMATH:** cc:14T90 | ab:"tropical geometry" & ab:appli*  = 176    
**MathSciNet:** pc:(14t90) OR r:(tropical geometry) AND r:(appli*) = 181
